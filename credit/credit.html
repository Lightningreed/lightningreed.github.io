                domestic tourneys up til this point and Comet Open is our first appearance on the international
                tournament-hosting scene. Quality means everything to us and we hope you'll have a great time watching or
                playing in Comet open— hell, we hope you'll have a great time regardless of the tourney itself. Please refer
                to our Discord [ hyperlink this link for “our Discord” https://discord.gg/BsBCZRqKHp] for any criticism or
                appreciation. As for questions, we'd really appreciate it if you decide to check out our FAQ [hyperlink the
